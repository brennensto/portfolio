            <p>In the big world of online shopping, where you usually find normal things, Funky Fashion Finds will be the complete opposite. It's not your usual shopping site, it's where you can find all kinds of weird and awesome things that are totally different from the usual stuff. As you browse through the items featured on the site you are sure to find some things you have never seen before. People will come to this site because it is a break from the normal everyday items that are seen all over the place. This site will bring those who are looking for things that might be a little harder to find. Users will come to this site wondering what they might find, but they will never know because the contents of the site will differ from most other things. This is why this site is so unique from other sites, because it is a place with only unique items. Users will go through a few different categories while browsing through the site. The first page will include a description of what the site is and will show what is on the other two pages. This site will show them different products and tell them how much they cost. They will then be redirected to where they can purchase the items. Some information my site will need would be various amounts of items to put onto the site and it will need the prices of the items. It will also need links to get to the place they are being sold. Users would choose this site over other sites because it acts as a center for many unique items and makes it so it is easy to find something new. The fact that the site will be exclusively about distinctive things will make looking for new things fun because nothing will be the same and everything will be out of the ordinary.</p>
